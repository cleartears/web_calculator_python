3.Description of problem-solving ideas
In this project, the basic goal is to complete the functions including input numbers and addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, subtraction, and then implement the functions including trigonometric functions and power functions.

Find information
After looking up the relevant information on CSDN, Bilibili, Github, I found that tkinter is very good for building visual interfaces

Design and Implementation process
1.Determine the needs: clarify the basic functions and characteristics of the calculator, such as the types of mathematical operations supported (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, square roots, etc.), the display format of the display screen (decimal places, scientific counting, etc.), whether continuous calculation is supported.

2.Interface layout: The calculator interface is divided into different areas, such as the number button area, the operator button area, and the display area. Determine the location and size of each area so that components can be added later.

3.Add components: Add components, such as buttons and text boxes, to each area one by one based on the interface layout. You can use the layout manager to better control the arrangement and placement of components.

4.Display processing: The user's input data is displayed on the display of the calculator, and the calculation results are updated to the display. Need to consider the formatting of the data display, such as decimal places, scientific notation, etc.
